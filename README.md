# smei.SpaceTime.model

In this work, the regression problem of spatiotemporal data is studied under the framework of the semiparametric model. A new kernel estimator for the spatiotemporally correlated data is proposed to improve estimation efficiency of existing kernel methods such as the local linear regression.
